# TodoWithPriority

## Description

This is a simple Todo app, but Todos are sorted based on "Priority."
You can run it both on iOS and on Android.

## Created with:

- TypeScript
- React
- React Native (with Expo)

Next I will implement:
- Data persistence
- Changeable parameters for Priority
- Show what is done
- Undo function
